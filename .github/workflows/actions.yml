  # When I first wrote this action, I found a deprecation for passing variables
  # through the steps.greet.outputs route. Since then, github requires you to 
  # deliberately declare the variable through an echo which is piped to 
  # $GITHUB_ENV. 
  # This $GITHUB_ENV is called env. in other steps.
